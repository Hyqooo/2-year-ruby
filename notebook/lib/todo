TODO:
  - Add check if notebook already has person with given name, surename, patronymic 
  - command: What is the best way to put a lot of input in one function call? 
  - command: remove function line: 60, that is probably not the best way to do such things
  - command: I need to write separate function for phone numbers
  - What if input file has a mistake, I believe that exception should be caught

TO ASK:
  - rescue error I can refer to parser version (2.1)
  - initialize has got 7 parameters instead of 5
  - how to write options hash outside of function initialize 
  - If I can parse phone numbers with regex
