TODO:
  - Add check if notebook already has person with given name, surename, patronymic 
  - We can't automatically parse address and separate this into street and number of house
  - I need parse phone numbers in the different way
IN PROGRESS:




DONE: 
  - Add equal function to know which person we look for
  - Add input from file
    - Parse file from human-readable format (Probably that would be YAML)
  - Add address class
  - Add distinct input functions for complex classes
